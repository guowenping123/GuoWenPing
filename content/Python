1. Assign a = 10 and b = 20. Print the result for (a + b)2 / (a - b).
a = 10
b = 20
print((a + b)**2/(a - b))

2. Implement the following tasks concerning a string variable.
(1) Define a string variable s = '' What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow."
s = "What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow."
(2) Return the number of characters in s.
print(len(s))
(3) Test whether s starts with the substring "What".
s.startswith('What')
True
(4) Test whether s ends with the substring "shadow."
s.endswith('shadow.')
True
(5) Find the substring "see" in s.
s.find('see')
(6) Based on s, return a new string with all occurrences of "you" replaced with "I", "your" replaced with "my", and "are" replaced with "am".
s.replace('your', 'my').replace('you', 'I').replace('are', 'am')
'What I am I do not see, what I see is my shadow.'
(7) Split s into a list of strings by white space.
s.split(' ')
['What',
 'you',
 'are',
 'you',
 'do',
 'not',
 'see,',
 'what',
 'you',
 'see',
 'is',
 'your',
 'shadow.']
(8) Turn s to all upper case.
s.upper()
'WHAT YOU ARE YOU DO NOT SEE, WHAT YOU SEE IS YOUR SHADOW.'
(9) Turn s to all lower case.
s.lower()
'what you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow.'
(10) Count the number of character 'y' in s.
s.count("y")
4
(11) Remove any leading (at the beginning) and trailing (at the end) white space in s.
s.strip()
'What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow.'

#3. Implement the following tasks concerning numeric types.
(1) Convert string "-100" to integer 100 and assign the result to i.
a = "-100"
i = -int(a)
print(i)
type(i)
100
int

(2) Convert string "3.25" to float value 3.25 and assign the result to f.
b = "3.25"
f = float(b)
print(f)
type(f)
3.25
float
